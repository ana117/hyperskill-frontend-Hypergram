# Hypergram
For every photographer, the process of creating an image does not end after pressing the shutter button. You will always be pressed by the need to tweak the photos a little bit to make them look like how you've conceived them. In most cases, the process of retouching a photo is not as easy as many would want to imagine. Let's create a simple app that can help you with image editing!

## Stages
**Stage 1/4: First steps**\
A professional photographer always has a tool that can edit photos. Build the foundations of your photo processing app.

**Stage 2/4: What a landscape**\
It's time to work with files. Add an ability to upload your beautiful photos to the canvas.

**Stage 3/4: A tiny pixel**\
Pixels are so small yet powerful. Learn algorithms to adjust the brightness, contrast, and transparency of your images!

**Stage 4/4: Download the result**\
Images processed by the app are so beautiful that users want to save them. So let's add an ability to download the edited images.
